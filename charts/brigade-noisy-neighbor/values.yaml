  # We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as
  # a conscious choice for the user. This also increases chances charts run on
  # environments with little resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to
  # specify resources, uncomment the following lines, adjust them as
  # necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.

  #   cpu: 100m
